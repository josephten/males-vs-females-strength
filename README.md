# Male vs female strength analysis

### Project overview

This data analyst project aims to provide insights on the relative strength differences between men and women that are of the same bodyweight. By analyzing various aspects of the strength data, I will seek to identify trends and patterns on what the differences are between men and women.

### Data sources 

strength standards: the primary data source used for this analysis is 'strengthlevel.com'

### Tools

- Excel (data cleaning)
- Tableau (data visualisation)

### Data cleaning/preparation

In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory data analysis

EDA involved exploring the strength standards data to answer key questions, such as:

- Is the strength difference the same between men and women on all exercises
- Does the bodyweight effect how much of a strength difference there is men and women
