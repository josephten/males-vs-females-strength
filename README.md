# Male vs female strength analysis

### Project overview

This data analyst project aims to provide insights on the relative strength differences between men and women that are of the same bodyweight and of the same experiencce level. By analyzing various aspects of the strength data, I will seek to identify trends and patterns on what the differences are between men and women.

### Data sources 

strength standards: the primary data source used for this analysis is 'strengthlevel.com'

### Tools

- Excel (data cleaning)
- Tableau (data visualisation)

### Data cleaning/preparation

In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory data analysis

EDA involved exploring the strength standards data to answer key questions, such as:

- Is the strength difference the same between men and women on all exercises
- Does the bodyweight effect how much of a strength difference there is between men and women

# Results/findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

- For squats , the relative strength between men and women is very similar across all experience levels at the same weight however the men seem to have a much bigger edge the heavier the bodyweights when they have little experience, however they get extremely close yet again once they have alot more experience (advanced and elite)
- For deadlifts the womens relative strength seems to be on average about 0.75x that of the mens across all experience levels and all bodyweights
- For the bench this seems to be where the men have a much bigger advantage then the women, starting off at about 0.5x the relative strength as the men whwne they both have little experience, but the closer they get to  elite the closer the relative strength gets to eachother at about the womens being 0.75x the strength as the men, this seems to be around the case for all bodyweights
- In general for the higher experienced men and women (advanced and elite) the relative strength seems to actually get abit worse the heavier the person however this seems to be the opposite for the less experience people (un-trained and novice) as there relative strength seems to get abit better the heavier the person, and seems to stay about constant for intermediates of the same weight
- It seems to be that the more lower body dominant the exercise is the closer the women are in relative strength to the men

### Limitations

- age is not taken into consideration which could vastly change the results
